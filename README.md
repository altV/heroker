# Heroker

This is only an example on how to manage your envs.

These bash wrappers are nothing more but empty binstubs for heroku environment instances management.
Furthermore, list is predefined - this makes it of little use.

## Installation

    $ gem install heroker

## Usage

heroku git:remote -a .. -r prod
hprod config
